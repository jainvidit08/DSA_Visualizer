#DSA Visualizer – Interactive Sorting Algorithm Visualizer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

The DSA Visualizer is a fully interactive web-based tool designed to help users understand the inner workings of popular sorting algorithms through real-time visual representation. Built using vanilla JavaScript, along with HTML and CSS, this project was created to demonstrate how algorithms operate step by step, making abstract concepts easier to grasp through visual learning.

The application allows users to generate a random array of customizable size and observe how different sorting algorithms work on that array. Currently supported algorithms include Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Merge Sort, each implemented from scratch in JavaScript.

Each sorting process is displayed with animated transitions, color-coded comparisons, and step-wise movement of elements to indicate the algorithm’s progress in real time. The visualizer includes controls for:

Adjusting the speed of the animations
Resetting and regenerating new arrays
Selecting different algorithms to compare their performance
The logic behind each algorithm is cleanly separated in the codebase, allowing for easy extension or modification. Algorithms are implemented using JavaScript functions, with careful use of asynchronous delays and DOM manipulation to achieve smooth visual effects and maintain synchronization between logic and UI rendering.

This project not only strengthens understanding of sorting algorithms but also demonstrates practical knowledge of:

JavaScript logic building
Event-driven programming
State management within the DOM
Frontend performance optimization
The DSA Visualizer is a strong example of how complex algorithmic concepts can be made intuitive and engaging for learners through interactive, web-based tools. It reflects both programming skills and a clear focus on user-centric design, educational usability, and clean code architecture.
